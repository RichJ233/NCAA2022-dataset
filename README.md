# NCAA2022-dataset

Recently, energy prediction, weather prediction, market prediction, pandemic spreading prediction, and other time-series prediction research areas have gained increasing attentions. For those typical problems, researchers have proposed various approaches based on machine learning and neural network. However, there is still alack of a comprehensive dataset for a fair evaluation. As a result, NCAA2022 datasets, including 16 prediction problems, are proposed to cover most characteristics of prediction model. 

According to the frequency domain characteristics, four typical datasets with non-stationary, periodic, impulsive, and chaotic characteristics are transformed into four types of problems, i.e., low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop categories. The prediction results based on NCAA2022 time-series datasets could reflect the performance of different frequency domains, and identify which type of problems can be solved effectively for a certain testing method. The algorithm robustness of complex tasks could be described by the comprehensive performance on 16 prediction problems.
